Lab 7.  Using the collections library
       
The collections library in Python contains a number of very useful data structures that can be applied to a programming problem.  For this lab, there will be a data source entitled DOHMH_New_York_City_Restaurant_Inspection_Results_sample.csv.  

1.  Read the data from the source.
2.  Create a data structure that looks like this:
{ OrderedDict{ Key = “Restaurant Name” Value = DefaultDict{“Key = CAMIS Number: Value = [Named Tuple of CAMIS records]}}
3.  Create a data structure that contains the following:  {key = CAMIS record, value = Number of violations}
3.  Create methods that do the following:
      A.  Allow the user to see all of the CAMIS records for a given restaurant. 
      B.  Tell the user the number of violations for a given CAMIS number.
