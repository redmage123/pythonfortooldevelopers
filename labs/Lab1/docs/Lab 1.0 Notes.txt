Lab 1.  Basic Python
       
      Exercise 1.  You will be given a file called AlBBsalaries2003.formatted.csv.  Please do the following:

1.  Import the 'csv' module from the Python standard library
2.  Read the file using methods from the imported csv module.
2.  Create a dictionary from the data that contains the following key/value pair.
      Key = the Team name
      Value = Aggregated salary value
3.  Allow the user of the program to type in a team name and output the aggregated value.
4.  How can we re-factor our code to make it,
      A.  More idiomatic?
      B. Shorter? 
      C.  Faster?

Exercise 2.  You will be given a file called Eur.pop.XL.csv
1.  Using the file as your data source, create a dictionary that contains the following key/value pair
      Key = Country Name
      Value = Change in population from first year to last year. 
2.   Allow the user to query the data.  Inputting the country name will return it's change in population.
3.  As with the first exercise, Consider how we can re-factor our code to make it better.
